1,Carrier,vault,<org_name>,<env>,defaultchannel,,,,For jenkins this is a separate job
,AAIS must share the certificate with the carrier.  AAIS will follow these directions:,,,,,,,,
,1. Get Orderer TLS cert from AAIS vault and convert to base64 encoded string.  Refer to Connecting to Vault Cluster (Org MSP and Orderer TLS Certificate),,,,,,,,
,2. Share the TLS Cert with Carrier,,,,,,,,
,Carrier now puts the cert from aais into the aws secrets manager,,,,,,,,
,3. Carrier uploads the TLS Cert to its AWS Secret Manager . Refer to Create Secret using AWS Secret Manager,,,,,,,,
2,Carrier,new_org,<org_name>,<env>,defaultchannel,,,,
,1.      Get Org MSP from Carrier vault. Refer to Connecting to Vault Cluster (Org MSP and Orderer TLS Certificate),,,,,,,,
,2. Share the Org MSP with AAIS,,,,,,,,
,3. AAIS uploads the Carrier Org MSP to its AWS Secret Manager. Refer to Create Secret using AWS Secret Manager,,,,,,,,
,1.1.1      refer to Creating CA TLS CERT for connection profile,,,,,,,,
,2.       in the deployment guide,,,,,,,,
,4. Update the config file for aais to include this new carrier org,,,,,,,,
,- get 4 or less name of node,,,,,,,,
,- setup org in aais-config-<env>.yml to add organization,,,,,,,,

4 ,Carrier,join_peer,<org_name>,<env>,defaultchannel,,,,
,Chaincode version should be same as the one used on AAIS for defaultchannel,,,,,,,,
5,Carrier,chaincode,<org_name>,<env>,defaultchannel,'-e add_new_org=true',,Format: MMDDTTTT,Don’t include the quotes
,for aais - Update organization configuration file with new channel analytics-carrier and chaincode information (channels section). Push the config file to repository,,,,,,,,
6,AAIS,add_new_channel,aais,<env>,anal-<org_name first 4>,"'--skip-tags=join,anchorpeer'",,,Don’t include the quotes
,AAIS node should be able to pull the analytics msp from aws secret manager which was added as part of add_new_org action on defaultchannel,,,,,,,,

,AAIS node should be able to pull the carrier msp from aws secret manager which was added as part of add_new_org action on defaultchannel (See step #2),,,,,,,,
8,AAIS,add_new_org,aais,<env>,anal-<org_name first 4>,,<org_name>,,
,on the analytics node - Update organization configuration file with new channel analytics-carrier and chaincode information (channels section). Push the config file to repository,,,,,,,,
9,Analytics,join_peer,analytics,<env>,anal-<org_name first 4>,,,,
,On the carrier node - Update organization configuration file with new channel anal-<org_name first 4> and chaincode information (channels section). Push the config file to repository,,,,,,,,
10,Carrier,join_peer,<org_name>,<env>,anal-<org_name first 4>,,,,
11,Analytics,chaincode,analytics,<env>,anal-<org_name first 4>,,,FORMAT: MMDDTTTT (anal channel prob better to use 1 character version if full fails),
,Chaincode version should be same as the one used on Analytics for anal-<org_name first 4> channel,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,(anal channel prob better to use 1 character version),
13,Carrier ,register_users,<org_name>,<env>,defaultchannel,,,,
14,Update the configuration files for the analytics node to include the new channel anal-<org_name first 4>.  This will be these files:,,,,,,,,
,-        channel-config.json,,,,,,,,
,-        data-call-mood-listener-channel-config.json,,,,,,,,
,-        transactional-data-event-listener-channel-config.json,,,,,,,,
,-        transactional-data-event-listener-target-channel-config.json,,,,,,,,
,"Update the channel config on the aais node, rerun the secrets and app jobs",,,,,,,,
,Restart the Analytics and AAIS nodes that participate with this carrier.  This allows the pods to be refreshed and pickup any changes necessary to see the new carrier node.,,,,,,,,
 The first step is to build the baf_image before starting the rest of the process. This action will build baf_image and push to the repository. In case this is already done and the image is latest the rest of the steps can be proceed.,,,,,,,,,
