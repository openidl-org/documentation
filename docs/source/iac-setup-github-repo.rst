Setting up the GitHub repository
================================

*	If you don’t have an alternate organization into which you can fork the openidl-org/openidl-gitops repo, then create that now
*	We are using the develop branch here.  If you don’t have one called that in your fork, then create that branch now.
*	Fetch the upstream for develop into your repository.
